Unlike LeftValues, however, FemScale normalises your scores before measuring the Matches.",
    "info_h2_changes": "What changes have you made from the original FPS-2?",
    "info_p_changes": "One alteration we made is the way we calculate the scores. In the original FPS-2, participants were asked to choose from a 7-point scale, and were given a score from 10 to 70 for each of the six perspectives, and 50 to 350 for FemScore; FemScale asks participants to choose from a 5-point scale and returns a recalculated score with the minimum of 0 and maximum of 100 for both the six perspectives and \"FemScore\". FemScale scores can easily be converted to FPS-2 scores by simply multiplying them by 0.60 and adding 10 (for the Perspectives) or by multiplying them by 3.0 and adding 50 (for \"FemScore\"). This was a deliberate choice, to both maintain its reliability and to make a comparison with results published in Henley et al. (1998), as well as other researches that use FPS-2, possible. We may, however, update some questions in the future, partially to reflect some contemporary feminist views and theories. We have also omitted the FemBehave score, due to its very low reliability.",
