        <h2 data-i18n="info_h2_femscore">What's "FemScore"?</h2>
        <div class="text-wrapper">
            <p data-i18n="info_p_femscore">"FemScore" is the average of all subscales other than "Conservative". Basically,the higher the Femscore, the more of a feminist you are.</p>

        <h2 data-i18n="info_h2_match">What's the "Closest Match" in the Results?</h2>
        <div class="text-wrapper">
            <p data-i18n="info_p_match">Much like 8values and LeftValues, FemScale calculates how well your views match with some feminist views, and returns the closest to you. Just like LeftValues, it also tells you how close you are to the other perspectives, with your closest match as 100% and farthest as 0%. Unlike LeftValues, however, FemScale normalises your scores before measuring the Matches</p>

    <div class="section-wrapper">
        <h2 data-i18n="info_h2_changes">What changes have you made from the original FPS-2?</h2>
        <div class="text-wrapper">
            <p data-i18n="info_p_changes">One alteration we made is the way we calculate the scores. In the original FPS-2, participants were asked to choose from a 7-point scale, and were given a score from 10 to 70 for each of the six perspectives, and 50 to 350 for FemScore; FemScale asks participants to choose from a 5-point scale and returns a recalculated score with the minimum of 0 and maximum of 100 for both the six perspectives and FemScore. FemScale scores can easily be converted to FPS-2 scores by simply multiplying them by 0.60 and adding 10 (for the Perspectives) or by multiplying them by 3.0 and adding 50 (for FemScore). This was a deliberate choice, to both maintain its reliability and to make a comparison with results published in Henley 1998, as well as other researches that use FPS-2, possible. We may, however, update some questions in the future, partially to reflect some contemporary feminist views and theories. We have also omitted the FemBehave score, due to its very low reliability.</p>

            <p data-i18n="info_p_issues">Please remember that you are not intended to get a 100% score in any of the categories. The point of the quiz is to challenge your views and understand the various perspectives feminism offer. If you have any suggestions or constructive criticism, please open an issue on the <a href='https://github.com/femscale/femscale.github.io'>GitHub Page</a> or fill out <a href='https://forms.gle/VfKqtp6vNMKBMoRm8'>this form</a> (English and Japanese available).</p>

            <p data-i18n="info_p_perspectives1">FemScale, as well as FPS-2, analyses your attitudes towards women using the following six perspectives as sub-scales: <b>Conservativism</b>; <b>Liberal</b>, <b>Radical</b>, <b>Socialist</b>, and <b>Cultural Feminism</b>; and <b>Womanism</b>. Marxist Feminism was not included by Henley et al. (1998) since it was not prominent in the U.S. Here is a list of all the perspectives and a brief discription of each:</p>
